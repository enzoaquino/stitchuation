# Competitive Analysis: Needlepoint/Needlework Apps

## Summary

The market is fragmented and cross-stitch dominated. No existing app is purpose-built for needlepoint. Every competitor either targets cross-stitch or is a generic needlework tool.

## Tier 3: Adjacent Tools (Not Direct Competitors)

| App | Type | Relevance |
|-----|------|-----------|
| Pattern Keeper (Android) | Cross-stitch pattern markup | Not inventory/project management, Android only |
| Markup R-XP (iOS, Android) | Cross-stitch pattern markup | Not inventory/project management |
| Stitchly (iOS) | Pattern creation | Used by some needlepointers for pattern work |
| Needlepoint.Com / KC Needlepoint (iOS) | Retail shopping | Shows community is app-engaged |

---

## Non-App Solutions Still Widely Used

- **Excel/Google Sheets** — Lord Libidan's free DMC inventory spreadsheet is popular
- **Airtable** — Used by more technical stitchers for sophisticated grouping
- **Paper/pen thread logs** — Still common, especially among older needlepointers
- **Physical organization** — Floss bags, numbered organizers

The persistence of manual methods indicates existing apps are not meeting needlepointer needs.

## Unmet Needs (From Reviews, Forums, Social Media)

1. **Needlepoint-first app** — every major app targets cross-stitch
2. **Cross-device sync** — top complaint across multiple apps
3. **Offline-first experience** — classes, shops, traveling
4. **Better UX for adding inventory** — existing apps are clunky for bulk entry
5. **Project-to-inventory linking** — "what do I have vs. what do I need" with auto shopping lists
6. **Deep needlepoint brand support** — Appleton, Paternayan, Planet Earth, Vineyard, Caron Collection, Kreinik, Rainbow Gallery, DMC tapestry wool, Bella Lusso, silk brands
7. **Canvas + stitch guide project model** — needlepoint projects are structured differently than cross-stitch
8. **Photo progress tracking** — more than 5 images
9. **Thread conversion charts** — cross-brand equivalents
10. **Social/community features** — Instagram and TikTok are where the community lives

## Pricing Landscape

| Model | Reception |
|-------|-----------|
| One-time $5-15 | **Strongly preferred** (Thread Stash, Thready, Pattern Keeper) |
| Annual under $15/yr | Acceptable (Threadalog, XStitch Plus) |
| Lifetime $45 | Appreciated as option alongside subscription |
| Monthly $3/mo | **Widely criticized** as too expensive (Threadster) |

## Needlepoint App Differentiation

| Advantage | Competitor Gap |
|-----------|---------------|
| First needlepoint-first app | Every competitor targets cross-stitch |
| Offline-first with sync (SwiftData) | #1 and #2 user complaints solved |
| Project sections with readiness indicators | No competitor has "can I start this section?" |
| Batch entry UX ("Add Another" with brand pre-fill) | Existing apps have clunky add workflows |
| Instagram/TikTok auth | No competitor meets the community where they are |
| Project-to-inventory shopping list | Partially exists elsewhere but poorly executed |
