# App Naming: Stitchuation

**Decision date:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** Accepted (revisitable)

## Name

**Stitchuation** — a portmanteau of "stitch" and "situation."

## Rationale

- Playful and clever, matching the app's warm & refined personality
- Immediately signals needlework/stitching to the target audience
- Works naturally in conversation: "What's your stitchuation?"
- Memorable and smile-inducing without being overly punny
- Pairs well with the design system's warm, craft-journal aesthetic

## Considerations

- 12 characters — fits iOS home screen labels (roughly 13 char limit)
- Spelling may not be immediately obvious from hearing it, but App Store search handles this well
- Domain and social handle availability should be verified before launch

## App Icon Direction

Stylized "S" rendered in stitches on a linen-textured background, using terracotta accent color. Playfair Display for any wordmark usage.

## Tagline

"What's your stitchuation?"
